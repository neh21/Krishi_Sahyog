# What it does
KrishiSahyog is a web application that allows farmers to register and authenticate themselves.
Once authenticated, farmers can create public posts detailing incidents of agricultural fraud, including types like counterfeit inputs, deceptive marketing, and land disputes.
These posts include relevant details such as location, date, and supporting evidence (photos, documents). The platform ensures anonymity, protecting farmers from potential reprisals.

# How I built it
KrishiSahyog is built using:

Node.js for backend development.
Express.js for the web framework.
MongoDB for the database.
JavaScript for the frontend development.
Authentication mechanisms and CRUD operations are implemented to allow farmers to manage their posts securely. The OpenWeatherMap API is integrated to provide weather reports.

# Challenges I ran into
Developing robust anonymity features while ensuring usability and security posed significant challenges. Integrating 
authentication and authorization mechanisms seamlessly within the application was crucial to maintaining trust and reliability among users.
Additionally, setting up an SMTP client to forward the reports to the authorities and follow up with them was challenging.

# What I learned
Through building KrishiSahyog, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of agricultural fraud and the specific
challenges faced by farmers in reporting such incidents. I also deepened my understanding of developing secure and user-friendly web applications that cater to a diverse user base.

#What's next for KrishiSahyog
In the future, I aim to expand KrishiSahyog by incorporating more interactive features such as forums or discussion boards
where farmers can share insights and strategies for tackling agricultural challenges. I also plan to enhance the
educational resources available on the platform to further empower farmers with knowledge and skills to safeguard their livelihoods. Additionally, I will make the website available in multiple regional languages.
